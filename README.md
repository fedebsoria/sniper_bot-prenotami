# sniper_bot-prenotami
This script takes a screenshot from the web prenotami.

First use:

1 - Insert user and password.
2 - push start and it will take the first screenshot and will be save in the desktop.
TO STOP: just close the window. Or in the console push ctr + C (windows)

Later uses:
The user and password will be stored.
ULTIMO USUARIO: this button restore the user and password.
BORRAR DATOS DE USUARIOS: this will erase the stored credentials.

SO FAR THE SCRIPT DOES NOT WORK IN UBUNTU
(there's a problem with SCROT and Ubuntu 22.01)
