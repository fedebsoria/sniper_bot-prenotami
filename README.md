# sniper_bot-prenotami
This script takes a screenshot from the web prenotami.

Once seted up the script will run automaticaly once a day.

First use:
    1 - Enter your email
    2 - Enter your password
    3 - relax and let the script do it all.
    DO NOT CLOSE OR USE THE PC UNTIL THE SCRIPT TELLS YOU:
     "Screenshot guardado en ".
    4 - The script will take another screenshot in 24 hours. Do not close the script.

Later:
    Once you have put your email and password the script will keep runing until you close it or shut down the PC.
    If you shuted down your PC or closed the script, you can re-run it and it will already have your email and password store.

TO ENTER A NEW USER:
    If you want to use a new email and password, you have to ge in the same folder as the script is and erase the file "user_credentials_file" and start again the script.

SO FAR THE SCRIPT DOES NOT WORK IN UBUNTU
(there's a problem with SCROT and Ubuntu 22.01)
